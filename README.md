# Idea.

1. Implement a game where the rules of the game should be made up on the spot . 
2. Since there are not preset rules, nobody can actually prepare for it.
3. Seems like most 2 player games are grid games / board games ( or can be converted into it).
So, it boils down to rules , 
4. So if rules can be decided on the spot that will add another layer of uncertainty to the game.
